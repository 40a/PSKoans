    Operators

    Operators in PowerShell can do a great many things.
    We'll start with some basic comparison operators. Unlike most other programming
    languages, PowerShell has a very specific format for its operators that
    largely differs from the common symbol-based operators.

    A PowerShell operator typically consists of a hyphen/dash (-) followed by
    at least two letters; sometimes more. For example, the equality operator
    that we've already seen in the previous koan is { -eq }.
