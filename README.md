# PowerShell Koans
Inspired by Chris Marinos's **fantastic** [F# koans](https://github.com/ChrisMarinos/FSharpKoans), the goal of the PowerShell koans is to teach you PowerShell through Pester unit testing.

When you first run the koans, you'll be presented with a runtime error and a stack trace indicating where the error occured. Your goal is to make the error go away. As you fix each error, you should learn something about the PowerShell language and programming / scripting in general.

Your journey towards PowerShell enlightenment starts in the *(TODO: Figure out where we'll start; the basics? Pester?)* file. These koans will be very simple, so try not to overthink them! As you progress through the koans, more types of PowerShell syntax will be introduced which will allow you to solve more complicated problems and use more advanced techniques.

# Prerequisites
The PowerShell Koans need PowerShell version 5.1 or Core 6+ to be run; make sure that you have a sufficient version installed before starting the project.

Additionally, the project will provide Visual Studio Code configuration for running. To be able to run PowerShell projects in Visual Studio Code, the PowerShell extension should be installed.
